# MR-IPT

This is the code repo for: 
Magnetic Resonance Image Processing Transformer for General Accelerated Image Reconstruction.


## Overview
In this work, we introduce the Magnetic Resonance Image Processing Transformer (MR-IPT), 
a ViT-based framework designed to enhance the generalizability and robustness of accelerated MRI reconstruction. 
Unlike conventional deep learning models that require separate training for different acceleration factors, 
MR-IPT is pre-trained on a large-scale dataset encompassing multiple undersampling patterns and acceleration settings, 
enabling a unified reconstruction framework.
